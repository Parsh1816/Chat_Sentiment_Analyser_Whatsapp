23/03/2020, 13:47 - Sunita Mem: Building projects is an essential part of learning during the engineering studies. There must have also been many cases where students have come to you asking for what project they should build, followed by a question on how to make them. We wanted to help students with this process.
¬†
¬†
¬†
Project Recommendation Tool
¬†
We at Bolt IoT have created a 'Project Recommendation Tool':

This tool asks students a few questions and intelligently recommends an engineering project they could build.

It also offers them a step by step tutorial on how to build these projects.

If they get stuck at any step then we have also setup a forum where they can ask any queries.

Here is the link to the tool:¬†https://info.boltiot.com/engineering-project-recommendation-tool
¬†
¬†
¬†
Benefits of using this tool

Using this tool will help students increase their chances of getting better placements, and I am sure it will help you improve the placements at U. V. Patel College of Engineering.

It will also help them make best use of their free time and complete necessary projects.

It will help them gain hands-on knowledge of engineering concepts.
23/03/2020, 13:47 - Sunita Mem: What is the fee for using the tool? We have made it FREE
We want the students to make the best use of their time during the holidays declared across engineering colleges due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Hence, we have made this tool FREE for a limited time. They will also get access to the project tutorial for free.
¬†
¬†
¬†
How to access the tool for FREE?
Here is the link to access the tool:¬†https://info.boltiot.com/engineering-project-recommendation-tool
¬†
¬†
¬†
How to share?

You could share the tool with the students by¬†forwarding this email.

You may also¬†WhatsApp the link¬†to the tool with the students.

I‚Äôm delighted to reach out to you and invite your institution to be a part of the UiPath Student Developer Program for the academic year 2021-22. The program focuses on enabling students to learn one of the leading RPA technologies from UiPath through engaging activities and workshops. It also helps students to build and hone communication skills, leadership skills, and a collaborative mindset.

This is the first time in India that Facebook & IncubateIND is doing an activity to create an AR Ecosystem using Facebook Spark AR Studio.

Website :- https://www.incubateind.com/hack/sparkarlabs

We all have seen those great instagram dog, flower filters, and most probably have used them too in the past, now is the time to create those filters, put them up on Facebook or Instagram and let the world use those filters. Idea is to build the ecosystem of AR around us and there are a lot of career opportunities which most students are unaware of.

There will be a hands on training workshop for students to learn how to use the platform, the self guide is attached here :- 

Steps for students to follow as Log on to the website - and register and create a filter, it's super easy. With each filter submission, irrespective of good or bad, the participant gets a branded T-Shirt & a certificate.

And the task in hand is simple, need AR effects thanking Frontline Health Workers - Doctors, Nurses, Policemen etc or challenge 2 is to encourage people to get vaccinated, making vaccination supercool

Recently, UC Berkeley entered into a five-year MoU with AICTE (the All India Council of Technical Education) to accelerate digital education in India and prepare Indian youth with skill sets needed to meet the demands of the digital economy.
UC Berkeley has also signed an MOU with NITI Ayog.
This program will enhance and supplement traditional education. This is a project-based program organized by the distinguished faculty from UC Berkeley, as well as mentors who are senior and retired executives from Silicon Valley firms. Given the very low cost of this three-month program, amounting to no more than a few hundred dollars, UC Berkeley is making it available to financially disadvantaged students who will not be able to afford a UC Berkeley education otherwise. Only aspirational and self-motivated students will be selected. UC Berkeley faculty will teach them the essential tools needed to develop their entrepreneurial and business skills. As there are no set pre-requisites for the program, anyone may apply. A certificate will be granted upon successful participation in the course for each student that will help them with their job placement.
Interested students may apply here at this link¬†https://fcba.berkeley.edu/program-in-business-innovation-analytics/

Details of the course are found here at this link¬†https://fcba.berkeley.edu/program-in-business-innovation-analytics/

Students will self-select one of the challenges that are achievable and that appeal to their passions, listed here:¬†https://fcba.berkeley.edu/program-in-business-innovation-analytics/

A digital copy of the certificate will be provided to those who complete the program. Your support in getting this information broadly circulated amongst your students will help the interested students, which is most appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

‚úíÔ∏è8 Sep, 2021

International Literacy Day (ILD) 2021 will be celebrated under the theme *‚ÄúLiteracy for a human-centred recovery: Narrowing the digital divide‚Äù.*

Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. It is a tool for daily life in modern society. It is a bulwark against poverty, and a building block of development, an essential complement to investments in roads, dams, clinics and factories. Literacy is a platform for democratization, and a vehicle for the promotion of cultural and national identity. Especially for girls and women, it is an agent of family health and nutrition. For everyone, everywhere, literacy is, along with education in general, a basic human right.... Literacy is, finally, the road to human progress and the means through which every man, woman and child can realize his or her full potential.

16/09/2021, 19:10 - Himanshu Sir Ganpat: I am expecting that CGV students have learnt from today's exam and also for other students I am expecting following things:
1. You should check gnu mail and personal submitted mail id to college at least once in a day.
2. Immediately inform subject concerned faculties regarding any issue arrived during exam
3. Check elective subject classroom because exam of elective subject is uploaded in different google classroom than common subject
4. Read each & every exam instructions given by subject faculties in classroom as well as in google form and follow all those instructions. 
5. Duration of Internal exam is only 1 hour. If you are taking more time to write paper due to any reason then strictly follow time of exam and you have to stop writing of exam paper at completion of exam. (Be punctual)
6. After completion of exam we have given maximum 15 minutes time to upload pdf file if you are facing any internet difficulties. 
7. No one is allowed after 15 minutes of exam completion according to exam rules.
8. If you are doing copy paste from any source like from friends and searching in google so that it will not increase your skill and it will affect your career also.
9. Now, in tomorrow's exam of MAD subject, Be careful timing of completion of exam and inform prior of any issue of internet to subject faculties
10. Check Classroom of MAD Exam in google Classroom otherwise inform to Rachna ma'm.
11. This issues should not be arrived in future exams also if it is in online mode.
12. One easiest way is scan Answer sheet from your mobile device and upload pdf file to google drive and submit pdf file in google form. (For mobile network, google drive app will not automatically upload pdf file)

I am opening CGV Google form responses from 07:30PM for 15 minutes for students who can not upload answer sheet today and you can upload your pdf file in that time.

Ratan Naval Tata is a leading Indian industrialist, investor, philanthropist and former chairman of the global Indian conglomerate, Tata Group of Companies.

Ratan Tata was honored with the highest civilian awards of India, Padma Bhushan in the year 2000 and Padma Vibhushan in the year 2008. In 1971, Ratan Tata was elected as the Director-in-Charge of the National Radio & Electronics Company Limited (NELCO) where he worked on developing a finer consumer electronics section.

Ratan Tata set a perfect example of humbleness and leadership as during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, he stood all alone outside the Taj hotel and helped the victims. He personally visited the families of all the 80 employees who were killed or injured in the attack.

Ganpat University - Energy Innovation Centre and Faculty of Engineering & Technology invites you to join us for Webinar on *Role of Microgrids in Managing Renewable Power Sources*

============================

Objective: The main objective of the webinar is to give an overview of Microgrids and its role in managing renewable power sources. 


Outcomes: Audience will be able to understand the technology evolution and growth of Microgrids. Faculties/students will get benefitted by understanding about the huge scope and potential of Microgrids in India and the World.

================= 

Abstract: The era of growing use of fossil fuels has lasted for about 200 years. Over this period, very close correlation has been observed between a society‚Äôs energy use and its economic strength. With the entry of solar PV, wind and biomass as renewable sources of energy, we now have distributed generation of electrical power, requiring newer methods of energy management. Energy supply systems around the world will undergo a major change. In this unfolding scenario, microgrids are a going to provide crucial system building blocks.

The technology of solar PV and battery storage has been improving steadily and will continue to improve. At the same time, costs have been falling and will continue to fall. The cost of generating and supplying renewable electrical power using rural and semi-urban microgrids will be lower than the cost of grid power. Therefore, rural and semi-urban microgrids present an exciting new business opportunity in locations without access to reliable grid power.

 

=================

Who can Join:

Anyone with interest in Renewable Energy; Faculties, Academicians, students, post-docs, Research Scholars from Science, Engineering & Technology discipline of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Business Management interested in Microgrids can join the webinar.

Open google site and by entering your enrollment number search your CP-II guide name and google meet link to connect with your Internal faculty member.

Every Saturday you have to report to your Internal faculty member. There will be a continuous evaluation on every Saturday. First review you have to complete by connecting with your Internal Faculty member before 05th February *(You have to contact Internal Faculty Member Allocated to You).*

Afterwards on every Saturday, at 09:10 AM, you have to connect using the meet link visible to you. 

Google site Link: https://sites.google.com/ganpatuniversity.ac.in/ceiteven22/6sem

Greetings from MIC and AICTE. 

The Ministry of Education‚Äôs Innovation Cell (MIC) in coordination with All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has launched Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2022 during the National Innovation Week held under the initiative of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav on 11th Jan 2022.

In the last 5 years, SIH has evolved into the world‚Äôs Largest Open Innovation Model to solve some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and problem solving mindset. Moreover, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India has applauded the SIH initiative on multiple occasions which has helped to kick-start the hackathon culture in India. The previous editions of SIH have proven to be extremely beneficial for the students in establishing startups and employment opportunities in various organizations.

Likewise, the previous editions of SIH, this year‚Äôs edition also focuses on software and hardware approaches to develop innovative solutions against the challenges faced by India's governing agencies including Ministries, Departments and PSUs as well as various private organizations.

Single Point of Contact (SPOC) registration for the institute faculty is now open on the SIH Portal (www.sih.gov.in). 

Also, a first talk on Smart India Hackathon 2022 is scheduled to be held on 9th Feb at 3 PM by Dr. Abhay Jere, CIO, MIC. We request all the institutes faculties and students to join in for the session to know more about SIH 2022.

09/04/2022, 12:37 - +91 99981 71606: Dear Students,

Greetings of the day...!

*What if I ask you to define the interview skills?*
Well, It's a myth that generally people believe it to iterate the things written in your CV in front of any interviewer. In an interview, hiring managers are looking to evaluate your fit as a potential employee by assessing your technical as well as communication skills. Obviously, after thinking about it next question that would strike our mind is:

*What are some of the most important interview skills?*
Some may suggest it like preparation, keeping it conversational, staying motivated and enthusiastic, and sharing your views/stories and research probably.

Hence in view of this; the department of CE and IT has decided to prepare our beloved students ready to face and crack any interview as far as the technical question preparation is concerned.

The department has taken the initiative to organize sessions of a couple of hours weekly every Saturday where the different subject experts of the department will focus on strengthening and sharpening your technical skills.
Just take an example of your core subjects and technology subjects, where the interviewer is aiming to trap you in the most intricate questions. So to avoid such tragic incidents, we will carefully plan and configure the session in such a way that you will be circumspect by such technical questions and FAQs of the particular course.
Say a course of data structure, DAA, DBMS etc..., you just name it, this session will give you an idea and make you aware about how to answer such questions or what kind of tricky questions could have been asked.
09/04/2022, 12:37 - +91 99981 71606: The said program is likely to start from today in WebEx. Kindly attend this program however by looking at your position as a final year student the department recommends and motivates you to join it.

*What if I ask you to define the interview skills?*
Well, It's a myth that generally people believe it to iterate the things written in your CV in front of any interviewer. In an interview, hiring managers are looking to evaluate your fit as a potential employee by assessing your technical as well as communication skills. Obviously, after thinking about it next question that would strike our mind is:

*What are some of the most important interview skills?*
Some may suggest it like preparation, keeping it conversational, staying motivated and enthusiastic, and sharing your views/stories and research probably.

Hence in view of this; the department of CE and IT has decided to prepare our beloved students ready to face and crack any interview as far as the technical question preparation is concerned.

The department has taken the initiative to organize sessions of a couple of hours weekly every Saturday where the different subject experts of the department will focus on strengthening and sharpening your technical skills.
Just take an example of your core subjects and technology subjects, where the interviewer is aiming to trap you in the most intricate questions. So to avoid such tragic incidents, we will carefully plan and configure the session in such a way that you will be circumspect by such technical questions and FAQs of the particular course.
Say a course of data structure, DAA, DBMS etc..., you just name it, this session will give you an idea and make you aware about how to answer such questions or what kind of tricky questions could have been asked.

26/08/2022, 09:23 - +91 99981 71606: Dear Sir/Mam,
Greetings from AICTE

Cyber Security is a serious system engineering problem and it needs engineered solutions. This is a crisis situation and the world needs a serious intervention to create millions of cyber defenders with deep system engineering skills.

Shortages in the Cyber D√©fense Engineering Talent pool are causing an uncontrollable torrent of cyber-attacks the world over with no respite. Lt. Gen (Dr.) Rajesh Pa√±t, National Cyber Security Co-Ordinator and Special Secretary to Govt of India recently opined that India needs over 1 million trained Cyber Rakshak right away and over 2.5 million Cyber Rakshak by 2025 to get the major share of USD 100 Billion global market opportunity in the next 10 years.

As per Michael Page, the world‚Äôs largest human resource consulting firm, there are around 3.1 million unfilled cyber security jobs worldwide today. If India/Bharat wants to bring true Cyber Resilience, we need to steer through a journey of talent creation in Cyber Engineering. A good surplus of Cyber Rakshak talent pool can bridge the talent gap and support the world economy.

Looking to the "Spate of cyber-attack and opportunity unlimited in Cyber Defence for Job", the time is opportune to Mentor 500000+ budding talents in the Next-generation Cyber Defence syllabus and ignite their minds for the Cyber D√©fense Engineering journey.

Considering the gravity of skill shortages, AICTE has partnered with Cybervidyapeeth Foundation, an educational entity dedicated to Cyber Defense, to provide Free 200 hours of intensive free cyber‚ÄìEngineering Skill Building on the "Cyber Offensive - Defence Engineering using the ‚ÄúVirulent Python" program from 1st September‚Äô 2022.
